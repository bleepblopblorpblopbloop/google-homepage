Google Homepage
This project is a simple recreation of the google homepage.  I am doing this to demonstrate my newly learned abilitie sin html and css.  By the end of this project I should have demonstrated that I can not only position elements of a webpage but also style them.  The intention of this project is not to build a functioning search page but simply to recreate the look and feel.  The links will not work but the elements will be correct.
